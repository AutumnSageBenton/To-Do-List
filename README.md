# To-Do-List


This project was created by Professor Avner Biblarz for California State University Monterey Bay's CS++ cohort Bridge Experience for Computer Science program. 
In this program I participated as a TA, along with 6 others, helping 3 professors create a 4 week course for the incoming freshman cohort to prepare them for the 
first quart of math. In addition, we also introduced basic coding fundamentals in Python and three projects to apply their learning; this being one of the projects. 

Project Prompt:
"In this crazed digital age, there’s just so much to keep track of - it’s easy to get distracted and
forget something important that you had to do. Wouldn’t it be great to be able to make your own
Python application to keep track of everything?

For this project, you will create a user-friendly command line interface for aTo-Do List.
When you start the application from the command line, you will have options to add to the
list, show the list, remove something from the list, or quit the application."
